I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Toronto in Engineering Science, majoring in Robotics with a minor in Machine Intelligence. 

I am currently working toward my undergraduate thesis at the [Robot Vision and Learning (RVL) Lab](https://rvl.cs.toronto.edu/) supervised by Prof. [Florian Shkurti](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/) (affiliations: [UofT Robotics Institute](https://robotics.utoronto.ca/), [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/), [Acceleration Consortium](https://acceleration.utoronto.ca/)). I am working on generalizable end-to-end robot manipulation focusing on task-oriented, multi-stage problems.

I have previously done research at the [Matter Lab](https://www.matter.toronto.edu/) supervised by Prof. [Al√°n Aspuru-Guzik](https://www.matter.toronto.edu/basic-content-page/about-alan) (affiliations: [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/), [Acceleration Consortium](https://acceleration.utoronto.ca/), [CIFAR](https://cifar.ca/)), Prof. [Milica Radisic](https://radisiclab.com/people/)  (affiliations: [UofT BME](https://bme.utoronto.ca/), [UHN](https://www.uhn.ca/), [Acceleration Consortium](https://acceleration.utoronto.ca/)), and Prof. [Florian Shkurti](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/) on general-purpose robotics for laboratory automation, and our publication "RoboCulture" is under review at Matter.

I am also a member of [aUToronto](https://www.autodrive.utoronto.ca/), the University of Toronto's self-driving car team, as a member of the 3D-object detection subteam. 

I am a team capitan of the [University of Toronto Varsity Blues Baseball Team](https://varsityblues.ca/sports/baseball) (3x OUA Champions) and two-time [OUA Most Valuable Pitcher](https://oua.ca/awards/sport_awards/baseball).
