I'm a first year Master's student at the [New York University Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/) studying Electrical Engineering.

Previously, I graduated from the [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/majors/robotics-engineering/) program at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), where I majored in Robotics Engineering and minored in Machine Intelligence. While at UofT, I had the opportunity to work with Prof. [Florian Shkurti](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/) (affiliations: [UofT Robotics Institute](https://robotics.utoronto.ca/), [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/), [Acceleration Consortium](https://acceleration.utoronto.ca/)) at the [Robot Vision and Learning (RVL) Lab](https://rvl.cs.toronto.edu/) on **generalizable end-to-end robot manipulation**. 

In addition, I did a 16-month research internship at the [Matter Lab](https://www.matter.toronto.edu/) supervised by Prof. [Alán Aspuru-Guzik](https://www.matter.toronto.edu/basic-content-page/about-alan) (affiliations: [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/), [Acceleration Consortium](https://acceleration.utoronto.ca/), [CIFAR](https://cifar.ca/), [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/)), Prof. [Milica Radisic](https://radisiclab.com/people/) (affiliations: [UofT BME](https://bme.utoronto.ca/), [UHN](https://www.uhn.ca/), [Acceleration Consortium](https://acceleration.utoronto.ca/)), and Prof. [Florian Shkurti](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/) where I developed *RoboCulture*; a **general-purpose robotics approach for laboratory automation**. 

I was also a member of [aUToronto](https://www.autodrive.utoronto.ca/) for three years, the University of Toronto's autonomous driving design team, where I worked on problems primairly involving **3D-object detection and localization**.

I was also team capitan of the [University of Toronto Varsity Blues Baseball Team](https://varsityblues.ca/sports/baseball), winning three [Ontario University Athletics (OUA)](https://oua.ca/sports/bsb/2024-25/releases/championship_recap) championships. I was also a two-time winner of the [OUA Most Valuable Pitcher](https://oua.ca/awards/sport_awards/baseball) award and proudly received the [Frank Pindar Men's Athlete of the Year](https://varsityblues.ca/news/2025/3/31/general-major-award-nominees-mens-frank-pindar-athlete-of-the-year.aspx) award.
