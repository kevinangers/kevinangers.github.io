title: aUToronto – University of Toronto Self Driving Car Team
subheading: 3D Object Detection
description: I co-led the development of a deep learning–based 3D object detection system, integrating state-of-the-art architectures (e.g., PointPillars, CenterPoint, PV-RCNN) with extensive experimentation in data augmentation and model optimization using the OpenPCDet toolkit for real-time deployment on our autonomous vehicle. I also co-led a 100+ student 3D/LiDAR labeling effort and participated in domain adaptation research between Velodyne and Cepton LiDAR systems. aUToronto secured 1st place in the 2024 and 2025 SAE AutoDrive Challenge II against nine other North American universities.
