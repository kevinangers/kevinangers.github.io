title: Cart Pendulum Control
subheading: Course Lab Project – ECE557 (Linear Control Theory). Code avaliable upon request
description: Designed an output feedback controller to enable a cart-pendulum system to track a square wave signal while keeping the pendulum balanced in the vertical upright configuration. Utilized state-space control design principles to design an observer for the linearized system, simulated in Simulink, and tested on a physical system using an Arduino.
