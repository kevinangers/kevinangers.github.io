title: Quadcopter Optimal Control
subheading: Course Project – ROB-GY 6323 (Reinforcement Learning and Optimal Control). Code avaliable upon request
description: I built a trajectory-optimization controller for a 2D quadrotor using Sequential Quadratic Programming with Euler-discretized dynamics, constraint linearization, and a filter line search driving a QP inner loop. I then extended it to a receding-horizon MPC that tracks shaped flip references and enforces state and input constraints (positive altitude, terminal angle band).
