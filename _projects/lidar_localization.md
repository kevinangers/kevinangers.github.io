title: Lidar Mapping and Localization
subheading: Course Lab Projects - ROB521 (Mobile Robotics and Perception) Code avaliable upon request
description: I completed a sequence of ROS-based mobile robotics labs using a TurtleBot3 Waffle Pi in both simulation and real-world environments, where I implemented global path planning (RRT/RRT*), local trajectory-rollout control, and LiDAR-based occupancy grid mapping. I also experimented with particle-filter localization and SLAM (AMCL, Gmapping).
